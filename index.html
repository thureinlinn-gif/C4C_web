                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Health care challenges can be related to environmental factors in several ways. Environmental factors such as air pollution, water pollution, and exposure to hazardous chemicals can cause or exacerbate a range of health conditions, including respiratory and cardiovascular diseases, cancer, and neurological disorders. Health care workers and patients may be particularly vulnerable to these environmental hazards, especially if they are working or living in areas with poor air quality or contaminated water sources.   
              </p>
              <p class="my-1 w-125 mx-auto mx-lg-0" >
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Additionally, the environmental impact of health care facilities and operations can contribute to climate change and other environmental challenges. For example, health care facilities are responsible for a significant portion of greenhouse gas emissions and generate large amounts of waste, much of which is hazardous and requires special handling and disposal.
              </p>
              <p class="my-1 w-125 mx-auto mx-lg-0" >
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Addressing these environmental factors and reducing their impact on health care workers and patients can help improve health outcomes and reduce health care costs. This can be achieved through measures such as improving indoor air quality, reducing energy use and emissions from health care facilities, and promoting sustainable practices throughout the health care system.

                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Carbon Footprint Calculator GAIA is a Python-based carbon footprint calculator that allows users to calculate their carbon footprint in three categories: transportation, waste, and electricity. Additionally, GAIA offers a feature that allows users to use their device's camera to take a photo and use object detection AI to identify items that contribute to carbon footprint. Then, they can ask questions about Carbon Footprint to Chat Bot.

          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Around the world, the concept of carbon footprint become widely known and seriously
          considered as the exposure of climate change is affecting influently our daily lives. The carbon
          footprint is the total combination of the greenhouse emissions that happen either for a
          commodity to be manufactured or for an acttion to occur. Not only several countries but also
          Myanmar government are commencing the carbon emission reduction plans and implementing
          their schemes into actions(Mulvaney, 2022).
        </p>
        <p class="text-black-50 news" >
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Myamar has provided its the Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) to restrict
          emissions of carbon footprints for the signing the Paris agreement in 2017(Myanmar at risk from
          worsening climate crisis - myanmar, 2019).Under the agreement, Myanmar has to reduce
          emissions, adapt to accomodate the influences of climate change,protect its current forests,
          biodiversity, invest in clean low-carbon electricity, restrict global warming "well below 2 degrees
          [Celsius] above pre-industrial levels while attempting to limit the increase to 1.5 degrees"(Mike,
          2020). However, as a poor and developing country, Myanmar government has to implement an
          action for environmental commitments in accordance with the national budget of the country.
          Hence, it would be better to actually initialize with the help of international community.
          However, such contributions will take a substantial amount of time and steps. Thus, alternative
          methods would be the options.
        </p>
        <p class="text-black-50 news" >
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Yangon, one of the most polluted city in Myanmar, the current air quality is 162(Air
          quality index) or unhealthy(Air pollution level). There are about 7 million people in Yangon
          where it is the most populated place and the center of merchandization. Due to the center of the
          Myanmar economy, aggregations of industries, automobiles, transportation, vessels, waste,
          utilizations of electricity trigger a huge amount of pollution and carbon emission(Yangon Air
          Quality Index (AQI) and Myanmar Air Pollution,n.d).
        </p>
        <p class="text-black-50 news" >
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the main reasons is vehicle emissions since the whole population employ a
          considerable number of cars, motorbikes, and vehicles which are mostly using on lower quality
          fuels and diesel fuel rather than their pristine correspondant resources which are at an
          internationally recognized level. Such fuels make higher levels of carbon emissions.In addition
          to that, Trucks and lorries , heavy weight automobiles in charge of carrying containers, goods,
          and other business uses are also using diesel. Since constricted places and policy to assess the
          age of the engines, fuels, and the vehicles are less found, old-fashioned applications also become
          an additional factor in increasing carbon emissions(Yangon Air Quality Index (AQI) and
          Myanmar Air Pollution,n.d).
        </p>
        <p class="text-black-50 news" >
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Emissions from factories are also to taken into account. As there are less an
          essential amount of development, implementations, and infrastructure which are under the
          international standardized level, it is also arduous to check crabon emissions from factories
          which utilize several amounts of fossil fuels, coals to produce the energy and commdoities. Then,
          the by-products of production are toxic contaminants and dangerous chemicals waste which
          reach to the atmosphere and flow into the rivers and seas. Furthermore, burning of fossil fuels for
          electricity, trushes and organiz waste materials, famlands, lower quality of contructions are
          adding to this carbon emissions(Yangon Air Quality Index (AQI) and Myanmar Air Pollution,n.d).
       </p>
       <p class="text-black-50 news" >
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a result, the amount of heat rises up due to the incrasing amount of carbon in the
          atmosphere which traps the heat from returning back to the outside of the earth surface.
          Consequently, there are several incidents and effects of climate change. According to The
          historian U Thant Myint-U, grandson of former United Nations Secretary-General U Thant, “the
          impact of climate change on Myanmar will be nothing less than catastrophic.” In 2019, the
          monsoon season, more than 100,000 people had to escape fro their places and over 70
          inhibitants departed from their lives because of a landslide and flooding affected by severe rains
          in Mon State(Myanmar at risk from worsening climate crisis - myanmar, 2019).         
       </p>
       <p class="text-black-50 news" >
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are alternative options to reduce carbon emissions such as Carbon Footprint Tax
          for Transportation, recycling waste into a new reusuable energy, Nuclear energy to replace
          burning fossil fuels.
       </p>
       <p class="text-black-50 news" >
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Among them, carbon taxes also known as carbon pricing is popullarly acknoledged as the
          most worthwhile method to decrease carbon emissions. A number of countries that implement
          carbon pricing and taxes including enlarging its current ones. For example, Sweden is one of the
          first leading countries to implement carbon pricing schemes successfully. Further, the Swedish
          carbon tax is the higher throughout much of the world with a price of US 123 dollar per tonne
          fossil carbon dioxide produced. In the Swedish energy taxation system, there are a carbon tax
          and an energy tax. The carbon tax was begun in 1991. The tax reform significantly reduced the
          marginal income taxes on both capital and labor, while at the same time expanding the base of
          the value added tax, among other changes. many people and business organizations can
          accomodate to the tax system due to the exchange system. The revenues from increasing the
          carbon tax offer contributions to the people alternatively by reducing general taxes in other
          sectors in order to also be gratified for lower income civilians(Schiebe, 2019).          
       </p>
       <p class="text-black-50 news" >
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All in all, the Swedish instance indicates that it is feasible to eliminate decreasingly
        carbon emissions whilst the ecominy growth is sustaining. Between 1990 and 2017, local carbon
        emissions lessened by 26 percentage. Meanwhile, the Swedish Growth Domestic Product
        developed by 78 percentage. On top of that, Sweden became the 8th country on the Global
        Competitive Index. in 2019. Infact, the 26 percentage emissions lessening is predominantly
        affiliated with the elargement of fossil free electricity manufacturing such as nuclear energy,
        hydropower, and bioenergy. Conversely, the considerable enlargement of the district heating
        system, which is essentially powered by household waste and diverse wood leftovers, has almost
        completely eradicated the applications of fossil fuels for heating reasons in Sweden(Schiebe,
        2019).
       </p>
       <p class="text-black-50 news" >
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The exemplification of the action of Sweden would be the best example for Myanmar
        citizens and government to learn how to encounter similar challenges.Nevertheless, such helpful
        applications are challenging for Myanmar where a significant amount of financial resources are
        required to tackle carbon footprint problems. This is because additional tax in Transportation
        increase the price of commodities, tansportation, and other financial challenges. That might decrease the Growth Domestic Product(GDP) of the country. Additionally, an advanced
        technology and resources from international scientits and engineers will be expensive. Moreover,
        even developed and affluent countries have to invest billions of dollars to build nuclear plants for
        producing electricity. Thus, it is hugely challenging to apply nuclear energy in Myanmar.
        Besides, utilizations of nuclear energy affect terribly the enviornments due to radioactive waste.                
       </p>
       <p class="text-black-50 news" >
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the government find it difficult to administer and implement carbon
        footprint taxation and other energy tax sheme, the individual civilians’ actions become matter. At
        present, the information flows swiftly from continents to continents, and from person to person.
        In Myanmar, “Myanmar now has at least 33 million active mobile subscriptions in a country
        with an official population of 53 million. Smartphone usage rate is reported at 80%(Digitalinasia,
        2018).” To acquire the awareness of taking action to fight against climate change, sharing the
        impacts of climate change and how to slove the problems can be widely spread. However, many
        people will think that solving the climate change would be challenging individually. Thus, the
        software development field comes to a throne in drawing the attention of such higher internet
        users. They can comprehend the disadvantages of climate change and how to encounter the
        issues with using only their mobiles by utilizing online tools such as a carbon footprint
        calculator. On their phones, they can know that they are responsible for how many amounts of
        carbon released . Afterward, they save the use of transportation by replacing riding
        bicycles,walking, recycle the waste as much as they can, and turn off the electricity when
        unnecessary.

        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tuberculosis is one of the most occurring diseases in Myanmar. The cause of Tuberculosis is 
        caused by a type of bacterium called Mycobacterium Tuberculosis. It spreads when a person with 
        active TB disease in their lungs coughs or sneezes and someone else inhales them which contain 
        TB bacteria(NHS choices, n.d).Malaria is also another main disease that is frequently occured 
        in Myanmar(Health in Myanmar ,2022). Research has shown that in every 1000 people in Myanmar, 
        at least one person has malaria. Malaria is a disease that can be caused by infections from 
        female Anopheles mosquitoes(World malaria statistics - knoema.com, n.d). Polluting activities 
        are resulting in malaria-transmitting mosquitoes expanding into regions where they previously weren’t
        (Shüné Oliver medical scientist, 2022). Using mosquito repellent wouldn’t be a reasonable solution 
        either when considered for the long term, as it has many side effects such as allergic reactions, 
        neurologic & cardiovascular side effects, and can also bring harm to our respiratory system(Khater et al., 2019).

        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Health care challenges can be related to environmental factors in several ways.
         Environmental factors such as air pollution, water pollution, and exposure to hazardous chemicals can cause or exacerbate 
         a range of health conditions, including respiratory and cardiovascular diseases, cancer, and neurological disorders. 
         Health care workers and patients may be particularly vulnerable to these environmental hazards, especially if they are working 
         or living in areas with poor air quality or contaminated water sources(Introduction to environmental public health tracking,2019).
       </p>
       <p class="text-black-50 news" >
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Additionally, the environmental impact of health care facilities and operations can 
        contribute to climate change and other environmental challenges. For example, health care facilities are responsible for a significant 
        portion of greenhouse gas emissions and generate large amounts of waste, much of which is hazardous and requires special handling and disposal(Introduction to environmental public health tracking, 2019).
       </p>
       <p class="text-black-50 news" >
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Addressing these environmental factors and reducing their impact on health care workers 
        and patients can help improve health outcomes and reduce health care costs. This can be achieved through measures such as improving indoor
        air quality, reducing energy use and emissions from health care facilities, and promoting sustainable practices throughout the health care system(Introduction to environmental public health tracking,2019).
       </p>
       <p class="text-black-50 news" >
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Developing an effective system to address environmental health in Myanmar requires a multi-faceted approach, incorporating awareness, practice, and public teaching. Here are some potential steps to consider(Introduction to environmental public health tracking,2019).
       </p>
       <p class="text-black-50 news" >
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. Awareness: Increase awareness and understanding of environmental health issues among the general public through education and outreach campaigns. This could include working with local schools to integrate environmental health education into the curriculum and engaging with community leaders and NGOs to raise awareness through public events and media campaigns.
       </p>
       <p class="text-black-50 news" >
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. Practice: Encourage good environmental practices, such as proper waste management and responsible use of natural resources. This could include providing communities with access to waste management services, promoting sustainable agriculture and forestry practices and encouraging the use of renewable energy sources.
       </p>
       <p class="text-black-50 news" >
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. Public Teaching: Empower healthcare professionals to provide guidance and education on environmental health issues to their patients. This could include developing training programs for healthcare providers to increase their knowledge of environmental health issues and equipping them with the tools to communicate this information to their patients.
       </p>
       <p class="text-black-50 news" >
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. Collaboration: Foster partnerships and collaborations between different stakeholders working on environmental health in Myanmar, including government agencies, NGOs, universities, and the private sector. This could help bring together expertise, resources, and funding to develop and implement effective strategies for addressing environmental health in the country.
       </p>
       <p class="text-black-50 news" style="margin-bottom: 0px;">
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Overall, developing an effective system for delivering environmental health to the people in Myanmar requires a coordinated effort between different stakeholders and a focus on raising awareness, encouraging good practices, and empowering healthcare professionals to provide education and guidance to their patients. As a real estate investor, looking for opportunities to support these initiatives can be a meaningful way to contribute to the overall health and sustainability of the communities in which you invest.
